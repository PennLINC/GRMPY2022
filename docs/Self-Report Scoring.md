# Self-Report Scoring

The GRMPY Self-Report Scales were scored and uploaded using the Custom-Info Upload Tool detailed in the Self-Report Score and Upload [Gear] (https://pennlinc.github.io/docs/flywheel/uploadingDocs/). The scoring code is an R script that can be found [here] (https://github.com/PennLINC/grmpy/blob/gh-pages/summaryScoring/GRMPY_selfReportScoringCode_v4.R).
