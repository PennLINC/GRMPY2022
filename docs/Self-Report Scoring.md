# Self-Report Scoring

The GRMPY Self-Report Scales were scored and uploaded using the Custom-Info Upload Tool detailed in the <a href="https://pennlinc.github.io/docs/flywheel/uploadingDocs/">Self-Report Score and Upload Gear</a>. The scoring code is an R script that can be found <a href="https://github.com/PennLINC/bpd/blob/master/summaryScoring/GRMPY_selfReportScoringCode_v4.R">here</a>.
